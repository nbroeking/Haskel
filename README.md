Introduction
------------

Functionally programming is hard... like extremely hard. Especially, from people who are used to imperative/object-oriented languages such as Java, c, c++, and javascript. It is our goal to introduce people into the functionally programming world with easy to follow tutorials, examples, and explanations to help those who are not as familiar with the dark side of the force. I mean functional programmingâ€¦
