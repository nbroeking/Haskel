Conclusion
==========

That ladies and gentlemen is our introduction/tutorial into Haskell. Haskell is an extremely powerful language that you can do so much with. So much in fact that we were not even able to scratch the surface. Haskell provides ways to multithreading, gpu programming, graphics, and everything that every other multi-purpose language can do. It even has a great foreign interface library that lets you use code from other languages embedded into the Haskell.
